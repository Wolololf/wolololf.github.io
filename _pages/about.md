## About

Hi, thanks for dropping by!

My name is Wolfgang, and I'm a game developer by day, and a history and linguistics enthusiast by night.

I've recently started dabbling in data science, to analyse and visualise specific topics I was interested in. I'm hoping that some of what I learnt on this journey will be of use to others.
